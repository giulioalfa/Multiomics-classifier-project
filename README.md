# Multiomics classifier project - USER MANUAL
## Introduction
Here we present the code and the related user manual for the Multiomics Classifier Project for Bioinformatics exam. The following instruction are useful in order to reproduce the results of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning experiments presented in the slides. The "Data" folder contains the pre-processed and structured data, ready to be fed to the models. Each folder in the project contains the useful python files to run the experimented approach. The models we present are:
* Machine Learning algorithms: Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Lasso, Rigde.
* Shallow neural network: basic multi-layer perceptron
* MORONET
* MORONET + Similarity network fusion
* Graph Convolutional Network + SNF
* 3-branch MLP + VCDN
* 3-branch MLP + 4th branch GCN with SNF + VCDN
